# fl_awesome Project Plan

## Hypothesis

- Federated learning models are overall less accurate than centralized learning models
- Differences in the amount of data across clients significantly affect model accuracy

## Technology

- Task: Imagine classification
- Dataset: [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

## Timeline

- Literature research
    - Explore FL and Predictive Uncertainty Estimation papers
    - Reproduce the algorithm from the papers
- Implement the project
    - Train models and record results
- Analysis and reimplement
- Write report
